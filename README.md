# Aircraft-Parking-Reservation-System
This project implements an aircraft parking reservation system. A "client" is able to search and reserve the available aircraft gates for a defined period of time (time slot) depending on the available number of gates and their corresponding reservations. Also, each client should be able to track and log his activity while interacting with the server. More details can be found in the attached pdf description.
Project is implemented using javafx and scene builder to design the GUI, and mySQL to store information in a database
Each fxml file contains the design of the scene as it appears when running the project
The mainController.java contains the implementation of each function used (pushing buttons etc.)
